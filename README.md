Face Mask Recognition Using CNN is a project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The model is trained on a dataset of 1500+ images of people wearing masks and 1500+ images of people not wearing masks. The model is trained on 80% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 20% of the dataset. The model is able to achieve an accuracy of 97% on the test set.
